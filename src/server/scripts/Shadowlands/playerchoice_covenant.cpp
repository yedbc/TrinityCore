/*
 * Covenant selection ("Which covenant do you want to join?").
 *
 * The client drives the covenant sanctum choice through PlayerChoice 644, launched by
 * SPELL_EFFECT_LAUNCH_QUEST_CHOICE (spell 343884, MiscValue 644) off the Oribos UI-link
 * gameobject. It is a plain player choice, so the server side is entirely
 * PlayerChoiceScript::OnResponse - CMSG_CHOICE_RESPONSE only validates and forwards.
 *
 * PlayerChoice 644 has eight responses, paired two per covenant by GroupID: one
 * "Preview Covenant" response (client-only; C_CovenantPreview.GetCovenantInfoForPlayerChoiceResponseID
 * looks it up in UICovenantPreview.db2, which stores exactly these four ids) and one "Join"
 * response that actually commits the choice.
 *
 *   GroupID | Preview response (UICovenantPreview) | Join response | Covenant.db2
 *   --------+--------------------------------------+---------------+--------------------
 *      4    | 2708                                 | 2689          | 1 Kyrian
 *      1    | 2686                                 | 2702          | 2 Venthyr
 *      3    | 2707                                 | 2688          | 3 Night Fae
 *      2    | 2706                                 | 2687          | 4 Necrolord
 *
 * Only the four join responses are mapped below; every other response id (the four previews
 * included) falls through the switch and is a no-op, so previewing never joins a covenant.
 *
 * Joining is done by casting the covenant's own reward spell rather than by poking
 * Player::SetActiveCovenant directly, so the Blizzlike side effects happen as on retail. Each
 * spell carries, on top of SPELL_EFFECT_SET_COVENANT (272) with the covenant id as MiscValue,
 * a SPELL_EFFECT_QUEST_COMPLETE (16) for its own covenant-choice quest and three
 * SPELL_EFFECT_QUEST_FAIL (139) for the covenants that were turned down:
 *
 *   299204 "Kyrian Covenant"    -> complete 56066, fail 56067/56068/56069, set covenant 1
 *   299205 "Venthyr Covenant"   -> complete 56067, fail 56066/56068/56069, set covenant 2
 *   299206 "Night Fae Covenant" -> complete 56068, fail 56066/56067/56069, set covenant 3
 *   299207 "Necrolord Covenant" -> complete 56069, fail 56066/56067/56068, set covenant 4
 *
 * All five effects target TARGET_UNIT_CASTER, so a self-cast delivers them.
