/*
    An all-or-nothing group proposal, used by solo-queue modes (Battleground Blitz).

    The plain battleground invite is per player: everyone who presses Enter Battle ports in immediately and a
    decline only removes the decliner. That is wrong for a solo queue, where a 16 player lobby that loses one
    member is not a match. A proposal is therefore layered on top of the ordinary invite: the battleground is
    created and everyone is invited exactly as before, but nobody is ported until EVERY member has accepted.

    Collapse is all-or-nothing in both directions. If any member declines or the deadline passes:
      - the members who never accepted leave the queue, as a plain invite timeout would have done;
      - the members who DID accept keep their GroupQueueInfo, and with it their JoinTime, so they return to
        the queue in the position they already held rather than at the back of it - they get their invite
        revoked, SMSG_BATTLEFIELD_STATUS_GROUP_PROPOSAL_FAILED, and then SMSG_BATTLEFIELD_STATUS_QUEUED again;
      - the battleground that was created for the proposal is dropped, so the next attempt picks a fresh map -
        which is exactly what retail does across the three proposal runs in C:\sniff\rated BG 12.0.7.pkt.
