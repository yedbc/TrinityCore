// Prey system + Voidforge — Midnight Season 1 solo-hunt progression.
//
// SCOPE: framework spine plus the hunt content skeleton. Ids are either
// DB2-anchored (wago.tools 12.0.7.68887 CSV) or quest-database keys recovered
// from the 12.1.0.69273 capture and re-verified against our own 12.0.7 rows.
// The hunt *activation wire* is still CAPTURE-BLOCKED (Hunt Table creature
// 245824 uses a mission-table-style opcode flow that no capture we hold
// contains), so StartHunt remains a documented no-op seam; CompleteHunt is
// live, because completion turns out to be plain quest kill credit.
// See C:\dumps\PREY_VOIDFORGE_BLUEPRINT.md for the full evidence inventory.
