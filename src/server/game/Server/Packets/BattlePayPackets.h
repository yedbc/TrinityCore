        // while every one of its neighbours has exactly two (a register in the BattlePay registrar at
        // rva 0x23D4360 and a null-out in the matching unregister at rva 0x23D4574). The dispatch is

        // the client's SMSG dispatcher is one giant switch, sub_7FF729103660, keyed on the raw opcode.
        // Each case runs three calls in order: a per-opcode PARSER, then a dispatch THUNK, then the
        // message destructor. The parser gives the wire layout; the thunk indirects through a global
        // slot that the BattlePay registrar (rva 0x23D4360) fills in, and THAT is what decides whether
        // the client does anything at all with the message.
        //
        // What the five delivery opcodes actually do in 12.0.7:

        //   0x42021F DELIVERY_STARTED   parser rva 0x608110  slot 0x4402910 -> rva 0x1D80E0

        //                               The client parses the body and calls a function that returns
        //                               immediately. NOT WIRED - see the refusal note below.
        //   0x420220 DELIVERY_ENDED     parser rva 0x608190  slot 0x4402908 -> rva 0x23CD870  (real)
