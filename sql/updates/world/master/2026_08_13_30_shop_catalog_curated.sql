--
-- The curated in-game shop catalog: 66 products, 74 deliverables, 9 pinned slots.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--   This catalog was authored directly against the live world database and existed in NO migration.
--   An audit of what is actually applied to the realms found the three tables populated while
--   sql/updates/ still only carried the original 9-row seed from 2026_08_09_00/01_world.sql. In other
--   words the shop the players see could not be rebuilt from this repository - losing the database
--   would have lost it. This file is that catalog, dumped back out of the live realm and committed.
--
--   It also explains why 2026_08_09_00_world.sql and 2026_08_09_01_world.sql read as "not applied":
--   they are not missing, they are SUPERSEDED. Their 9 seed products overlap this catalog by content
--   under different ids (seed 574806 "Soul of the Aspects" is product 51 here), so replaying them
--   would inject duplicate cards rather than repair anything. Do not run them against a realm that
--   has this file.
--
-- SAFETY
--   Scoped DELETE-then-INSERT over exactly these three tables, which are pure server-authored
--   reference data - no player state, no entitlements, no purchase history. Re-runnable.
