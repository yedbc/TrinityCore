-- In-game Shop character boost: which characters this realm has boosted.
--
-- The boost itself is applied to an OFFLINE character from the glue screen, so `characters` already
-- carries everything the boost changed (level, xp, primarySpecialization, inventory, the
-- character-select equipment cache). What that leaves nowhere to live is the FACT of the boost, and
-- the character-enumeration packet needs it: a boosted character must carry
-- CHARACTER_FLAG_4_USED_MAX_LEVEL_BOOST so the client stops offering the boost again, and a character
-- created through "Try New Class" must carry CHARACTER_RESTRICTION_FLAG_TRIAL_BOOST until it is
-- boosted so the client draws the class-trial plate.
--
-- This is a CHARACTERS-database table, unlike the entitlement ledger it is fed from
-- (account_battlepay_entitlement, auth DB). The entitlement belongs to the account and outlives any
-- realm; this row is a property of one character on one realm and dies with it, which is why
-- CHAR_DEL_SHOP_BOOST is issued from the character-delete path.
--
--   trial = 1  character was created through Try New Class and has NOT been boosted yet
--   trial = 0  character has been boosted; the entitlement that paid for it is consumed
--
-- `distributionId` is the entitlement (wire DistributionID) that paid for the boost, kept so a
-- support query can walk a boosted character back to the purchase that produced it. It is 0 for a
-- trial row, because a trial does not consume an entitlement.
